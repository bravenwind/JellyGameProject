Liquid Shader by Triple Axis
-------------------------------

Thank you for purchasing Liquid Shader by Triple Axis!
The workflow for setting up a contained liquid is pretty simple.
This guide will walk through the basics for you as well as mention some important
features of the shaders.

Basics:
	This package includes two shaders: Glass.shader and Liquid.shader
	The glass shader will be applied to any material/object that contains the liquid.
	The liquid shader will be applied to any liquid mesh.

	A liquid mesh can take any shape. In most cases, it can be the container's mesh.
	A liquid object must have the Liquid.cs script attached to it to pass variables
	to the shader such as the cutoff position, positional/angular velocities, wave
	intensity, and more.
	The object may also have a reflection probe used to reflect and refract the scene
	surrounding it.

	In the example scene, there are a few objects that contain a liquid in them. All of
	these objects share the same mesh with their liquid object.

	Now that we've covered the basics, let's learn about the Liquid.cs script.

Liquid.cs:
	The liquid script must be placed on any liquid object in the scene.  The role of this
	script is to send variables to the liquid shader.  You'll rarely have to call
	this script's functions.  Instead, there are a few properties exposed in the
	inspector that you can change.

	Properties:
	- Volume Mesh: This is the mesh used when calculating the liquid volume. Usually
		this can be a lower level of detail version of the liquid object's mesh.  If
		none is provided, this will default to the liquid object's mesh.
	- Plane Position: This vector is the cutoff plane of the shader.  The higher the
		Y value is, the more the object will fill up.  The lower it is, the less it
		will fill up.

Liquid.shader:
	The liquid shader is applied to any object that you want to act as a liquid.
	This shader has a lot of properties to allow for customization.

	Properties:
	- Refraction Method: Determines whether to use a reflection probe or a GrabPass
		when reflecting/refracting the object's surroundings.  A reflection probe will
		look the best while a grabpass will be more performant.
	- Liquid Color: The color of the liquid.  You can also assign a texture.
	- Normal Map: The normal map of the liquid.  Instead of using the mesh's UVs, a
		biplanar (XZ) mapping will be used.
	- Wave Map: The wave pattern shown when moving or rotating the liquid.
	- Perlin Noise: A texture used for internal functions of the shader.  This is also
		used as the foam's texture.
	- Bubble Texture: The texture of the liquid's bubbles shown when moving or rotating
		the liquid.
	- Refraction Index: The refraction index of the liquid.  The higher it is, the more
		the liquid refracts.
	- Murkiness: Applies a blur to the reflection probe cubemap.  Only applies when
		using the ReflectionProbe refraction method.
	- Syrup: Simulates a syrup property by making the liquid less see-through.
	- Fresnel Power: The width of the reflections shown on the sides of the mesh.
	- Bubble Scale: The scale of the liquid's bubbles.
	- Bubble Count: The maximum number of bubbles spawned when moving or rotating the
		object.
	- Surface Color: The color of the liquid's surface (the backface).
	- Foam Color: The color of the foam shown when moving or rotating the object.
	- Edge Thickness: The height of the surface edge.
	- Meniscus Height: The height of the meniscus seen on the sides of the mesh.
	- Meniscus Curve: The curve of the meniscus.
	- Foam Amount: The maximum amount of foam shown.

Glass.shader:
	The glass shader is a specially designed shader to mimic old glass containers.
	This shader is a six pass shader with four GrabPasses making this a slightly
	expensive shader, but it looks great.  It is capable of blurring the background
	and showing the back of the container's labels as well as adding a nice reflection
	to the glass using the liquid object's reflection probe (if present).

	Properties:
	- Glass Color: The main color of the glass.  The texture acts as a way to put labels
		on the glass with the alpha channel dictating the absence of a label.
	- Normal Map: The bumpmap of the glass.  This also acts as the background distortion
		texture with the intensity value shown to the right of the texture input.
	- Roughness Texture: A detail map used to set the roughness of the glass.
	- Blur Amount: Determines how much the background will be blurred.
	- Fresnel Power: The width of the fresnel effect seen on the sides of the mesh.
		The color of the fresnel is the same color as Glass Color.
	- Thickness: The thickness of the glass used for the label's backface.
	- Draw Backface: Determines whether to draw the label's backface.  Turn this off
		if you are experiencing issues with the liquid disappearing at certain angles.
		This seems to be a bug with Unity.


Tips:
	- Reflection probes look a lot better than GrabPasses on the liquid shader because
	they are more accurate to real life refractions and also allow the glass shader to
	accept a reflection.
	- If your liquid object disappears at certain angles inside a glass container,
	turn off "Draw Backface" to fix this.  This seems to be a bug with Unity.
	- The liquid shader does not react to the mesh's volume underneath the cutoff plane
	which means, depending on the mesh's shape, the liquid will not hold the same amount
	in it at different rotations.  You can see this in action with the laboratory flask
	in the example scene compared to the sphere.

Nerdy Cool Things:
	- Did you know the glass shader is not technically translucent?  Well it is
	considered a "transparent" object since it's in the transparent shader queue,
	but it's technically opaque with the grabpasses simply being projected onto it.
	- The glass shader projects a shadow with differing levels of semi-transparency
	depending on how see through the glass is.  You can see how the shadow dithers
	if you use hard shadows.  This is the same technique the Standard shader uses!
